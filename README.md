# Sublime Keybindings

Ports Sublime keybindings to VS Code for Mac. 

There was a lot to do here, so if you find something missing please open an issue and let me know. 

Todos:

- Windows / Linux keybindings.
- Finish conversion tool. See `convert.js` for the code to migrate Sublime key bindings to VS Code key bindings with a script.
