# Sublime Keybindings for VS Code
The Sublime Keybindings extension maps common Sublime keybindings to VS Code keybindings. After installing the extension and restarting Code your favorite
key bindings from Sublime are now available. For example, `alt+cmd+/` uncomments a line. See [package.json](package.json) for the complete list of bindings
supported today.
