# Sublime Keybindings for VS Code

The Sublime Keybindings extension maps common Sublime keybindings to VS Code keybindings. After installing the extension and restarting Code your favorite
key bindings from Sublime are now available. 

> Note - Windows and Linux keybindings have not been implemented.
